Game Jam winter 2025
Theme: Bubble

Brainstorming:

1)
Capture the flag on floating island, use largish bubbles as vehicles, shoot the other team's bubbles to pop them.
pop bubbles over the void to temporarily knock out a player
shoot the ground to make it slippery for enemies (splatoonishly?)
shooting grounded players knocks them back, slightly

I like the idea but it requires a lot of players/devices, also unsure about networking setup at the jam
split screen can help with device number

I think it's too much scope

Alternatively:
2)
Same setting but...
KOTH style 1v1
Only one floating island, simply ring out to win, ridable bubbles at the edges to increase survivability
slipperiness is symmetric, not based on who shot the ground, direct hits do very slight knockback, not very effective on dry ground
edges are always slippery

boost/dash, on a short cooldown, ramming can cause big knockback but missing could easily be fatal
also good for getting back from the edge

ridable bubbles:
shrink over time and when getting shot, then pop.
faster movement, but hard to slow down, can lead to overshooting the edge and being open to getting your bubble popped
(perhaps movement influence is inversely proportional to current speed?)

Rivers of bubbles as a fixed hazard, slippery and pushes

2 fire buttons, hold one for auto fire, hold the other to grow a single bubble release to fire, larger bubbles travel faster/farther/more accurately

bubble mine, sticks to the ground, can be moved around by shooting, touching it causes it to explode and knock upwards and away

NOTE will need voluntary help playtesting a lot during the jam
